# üìà Automated Capital Gains & Advance Tax Calculator

This Python-based application provides a comprehensive solution for Indian taxpayers to calculate capital gains from foreign-listed employee stock units and to estimate the corresponding advance tax liability. The software automates the entire workflow, from fetching official exchange rates to generating a fully validated, multi-sheet tax report ready for auditing and ITR filing.

The architecture is designed to be scalable and maintainable, making it an ideal foundation for a full-fledged tax advisory software.

## ‚ú® Key Features

* **Automated Exchange Rate Fetching:** Downloads the latest **SBI Telegraphic Transfer Buying Rate (TTBR)** data directly from its source. No manual rate management is needed.
* **Compliant Currency Conversion:** Implements the official tax rule by using the TTBR from the **last day of the month preceding each transaction** for ultimate accuracy.
* **Intelligent Rate Handling:** Automatically uses the most recent available rate if the exact month-end date is a holiday and logs these instances in a dedicated report sheet for full transparency.
* **Accurate Indian Tax Logic:**
    * Correctly classifies gains as **Long-Term (LTCG)** or **Short-Term (STCG)** based on the 24-month holding period.
    * Implements the official **tax set-off rules**, correctly adjusting losses against gains.
    * Calculates the final liability including surcharge (based on total income) and cess.
* **Precise Advance Tax Schedule:** Uses the correct **cumulative method** to estimate your advance tax liability for each installment deadline.
* **Financial Intelligence:** Includes a **Tax-Loss Harvesting** report to identify potential opportunities to offset gains by selling assets at an unrealized loss.
* **Comprehensive Validation:** Runs a full suite of sanity and integrity checks on all input data and calculation results, printing a clear validation report.

## üìä Understanding the Excel Report

The generated Excel file is designed to be a complete, self-explanatory audit trail:

* **Profit Loss Summary:** The most detailed sheet. For every transaction slice, it shows the USD prices, the **exact TTBRs used** for sale and acquisition, the resulting **INR proceeds and costs**, and the final profit/loss.
* **Tax Calculation Explained:** A dedicated sheet with a step-by-step guide in plain English explaining how the currency conversion and tax liability are calculated according to Indian tax law, with direct references to ITR-2 form schedules.
* **Tax Calculation:** The main summary sheet showing the set-off of gains/losses, the final tax liability, the advance tax schedule, and a summary of all validation checks.
* **Tax Loss Harvesting:** An actionable report showing vested shares currently at a loss, which could potentially be sold to offset gains.
* **TTBR Rates Used & Warnings:** Audit trail sheets listing every unique TTBR that was used and any fallbacks that were necessary due to holidays.
* **Acquisition Lot Status:** Shows every acquisition lot, the **total shares sold** from it, and the **total shares remaining**, providing a clear view of the FIFO process.
